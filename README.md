# AmazonDataCollector
AmazonDataCollector is a project I wrote to automate and optimize data collection/analysis process during work. Currently it supports 
1. collecting product ranking data by keywords  
2. collecting product basic information (title, description, price, brand, etc.) by ASINs
3. collecting product review information (number of review, date of review, rating of review) by ASINs and given year range

# Usage
1. Download this folder and fill the template CSV file with the keywords/ASINs
2. run "ã€‚/main.py" in your shell
